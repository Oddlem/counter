- This was the first project I made using react.js and bulma, I decided on making a counter app so I could learn folder heiarchies and where logic is store and excecuted. I documented the steps I took for setting up the project in documentation.md, in notes.md I wrote down any new concepts I learned and things I needed to research. 

# Folder Scaffolding:
- `src/components/common` contains the component itself, with the component's logic. In this case, it contains the logic the allows the number to tick up or down on click.
- `layout` is the app's styling which, in this case, is some css I amde since I did not use a css framework here.
- Since the app is meant to be simple, `services` and `utils` were not utilized and do not contain any files.
